1. Customer inquiry: Can you prepare grapes, melon, some Jamón Ibérico, cheese, and some sandwiches that can hold for quite some time as the arrival hour is uncertain?
2. Food requirements: Food that can be in the fridge and last overnight if needed, just one box mixed is enough.
3. Dietary request: No green decoration leaves as they wilt quickly.
4. Suggestion of menu item: Maybe a mix of mini burgers could fit in the box instead.
5. Confirmation of menu item: Perfect, mini burgers instead of the original items.
