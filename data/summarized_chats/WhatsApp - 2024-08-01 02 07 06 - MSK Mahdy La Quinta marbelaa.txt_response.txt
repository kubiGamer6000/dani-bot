1. Customer feedback on food quality and suggestions for improvement:
   - The roast beef sandwiches were not edible. The beef was hard and tasteless. Recommend using filet and cutting it thinner with more flavor.
   - The mini burgers were OK but below expectations.
   - The tuna was excellent.
   - The chicken was very good.
   - The salmon was very good, but recommend upgrading to a higher quality salmon type.
   - Some chips were stale; recommend consistency.
   - Suggested improvement for presentation: boxes should have a mix of sandwiches for convenience.
   - Recommended developing a bag with a wide base to fit boxes properly to avoid damage to food during transport.
   - Advice on box design: a plastic see-through cover would allow for convenience and cleanliness post-use.
   - Suggested including napkins, wet wipes, and plastic cutlery with the dips.
