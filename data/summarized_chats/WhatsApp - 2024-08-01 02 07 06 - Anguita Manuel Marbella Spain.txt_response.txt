1. Customer inquiry: The idea is to do something similar to what you did in the gallery on the day of the Rafael junior exhibition.
2. Catering options inquiry: Do you have a list of different options for the catering?
3. Service details: The tables are at the house and we can also provide the glassware; it would just be the food and waiters.
